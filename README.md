-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid (to center main)
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that line-height property is really efficient and like this projects that have multiple and exact layout we should keep less code with same class name.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.para {
    line-height: 1.75;
}
.btn {
    .....;
}
.btn1 {
    .....;
}
.btn2 {
    .....;
}
.btn3 {
    .....;
}
```
